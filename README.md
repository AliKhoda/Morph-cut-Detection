# Morph-cut Detector

This repository contains snippets of the code used in the following publication:

T. Nielsen, A. Khodabakhsh, C. Busch, “Unit-Selection Based Facial Video Manipulation Detection”, BIOSIG, 2020.

To download the corresponding dataset, please visit:

The purpose of this repository is to provide the core sections of the proposed method and by no means provides a functional implementation. The codes have dependency on the CyclicGen python files and these files should be copied under the same directory.
